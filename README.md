### Instructions To Run:

1. Clone the repo and import/open it in your Java IDE of choice(We used[ Intelli J](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ " Intelli J"))
2. To run with Intelli J, navigate throught the file tree and then click `Main.class`. This will run a small demo showcasing what the API can do. For more detail check out the [ UML](https://github.com/SebastianKurp/Comp373-Facility-Management-System/blob/master/UML1.PNG " UML") in the root of the repo.
3. If not using Intelli J or another IDE, _not recommended_, `cd` into the `src` directory. Run `javac Main.java` to complie the project and then run `java Main` to run the demo.
4. **To run all the test at once** right click the src in Intelli J and click `run all tests`

### UML Diagram

Can be found either in the PDF or for a better rendering using a tool that can read UML files(intelij has a great one)

### Patterns 
## Bridge:
###### Problem solved:
Having duplicate functions and an inability to reuse code if another building, floor, maintenanceOffice, or certain staff is added.

The Bridge Pattern is used through project through our interface and model approach. The interfaces act as simple ways to interact with the models and allow us to cut out the redundancy.  For example, within our `BuildingInterface` an admin to easily create add multiple floors or even create a new building.
```
BuildingOne = Building.addFloor(floorNumber), Building.addRoomToFloor(floorNumber, roomNumber, roomType,â€¦etc);

```
Another interface is the `MaintenanceInterface` which allows admin or maintenance staff easy creation or request for informations to be handled with ease.
```
MaintenanceOffice.assignMainStaff(MaintenanceStaffMemberID, MaintenanceRequestId
```

To even make things easier we added a admin interface which allows interaction with the staff, building, user, and maintenance interfaces.


## Observer:
###### Problem Solved:
Staff announcements created in the staff registry (observable) update each individual staff member's (observer) announcement when the announcement is changed. This allows the system to change the announcement in one place and have the changes applied throughout each staff member.
