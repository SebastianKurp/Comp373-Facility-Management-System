Paul mostly everything is done and I just need you to do the following:
- Finish and add maintenance/user functions to the AdminDesk(Check if what I coded works)
- Add User and Maintenance/User functions to FrontDesk(Check if what I coded works)
- Add Maintenance to UserInterface
- AdminOfficeTest
- FrontDeskTest
- UserInterfaceTest(If you don't want to do this one, just remove it in the client folder)

-If all our tests work we can remove the demo if you want, but if you have a strong urge code you can code one out lol

- When you're done just PM and I'll update the UML
